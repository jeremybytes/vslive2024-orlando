## Sessions  

**VSF02 Hands-On Workshop: Take Your C# Skills to the Next Level**  
*Level: Intermediate*  

Are you a C# developer eager to create software that is easy to maintain, has minimal bugs, and makes your users happy? This workshop is for you.

Through lectures, code samples, and hands-on labs, you will learn how interfaces, delegates, dependency injection, and unit testing can help you write applications that are easy to extend, change, and debug. Along the way you will also encounter modern C# topics such as nullability, switch expressions, and asynchronous code. In the end, you will take away practical experience that you can immediately apply to your own projects.

Workshop Topics:

* **Interfaces**: Explore the art of writing clean, modular code through interfaces. Learn how interfaces facilitate code extension, make your applications more testable, and lead to fewer bugs.  
* **Delegates**: Gain a deep understanding of delegates and learn how to use them to build flexible and extensible code.  
* **Dependency Injection**: Discover the magic of dependency injection and how it promotes loose coupling, making your codebase more flexible, testable, and maintainable.  
* **Unit Testing**: Write tests that ensure your code functions as expected, enabling you to catch bugs early in the development process.

Key Benefits:

* **Easier Maintenance**: Explore practices for writing clean, maintainable code that's a breeze to work with, whether you're collaborating with a team or revisiting your own projects down the road.  
* **Fewer Bugs**: Learn the art of writing robust code that is easy to test. Find bugs before your users do, and be confident that code changes do not break existing functionality.  
* **Happier Users**: The point of writing software is to meet your user's needs. With these tools in hand, you can create applications that not only meet but exceed user expectations.  

Pre-Requisites:

Basic understanding of C# and object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, methods, and properties). No prior experience with the primary topics is necessary; we'll take care of that as we go.

Take your C# development skills to the next level and build software that not only satisfies your users, but also simplifies your life as a developer. Say goodbye to frustrating bugs, hello to happier users, and welcome to the world of painless maintenance.

You will learn:

* Create loosely-coupled code using interfaces, delegates, and dependency injection.  
* Find bugs quickly with unit tests (and make sure existing code continues to work.  
* Write code that can be easily updated to meet your users' changing needs.  

Attendee Requirements:

* You must provide your own laptop computer for the hands-on lab portions of the day.  

* Interactive labs can be completed using Windows, macOS, or Linux -- anywhere .NET 8 will run.

* You need to have the .NET 8 SDK installed as well as the code editor of your choice (Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition or Visual Studio Code are both good (free) choices).  

* You will also need the lab files with the code and instructions. These can be obtained from this repository (in the Labs folder) or from the separate "Labs Only" repository noted below.  

Links:

* .NET 8.0 SDK  
[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

* Visual Studio 2022 (Community)

Note: Install the "ASP.NET and web development" workload for the labs and samples. Include ".NET desktop development" for "digit-display" sample and WPF-based samples.

**VSTH13 Design Patterns: Not Just for Architects**  
*Level: Introductory*  

Design patterns are not just for architects. In fact, you already use Design Patterns but probably don't know it. Observer, Facade, Iterator, Proxy - these are all patterns that allow us to better communicate our ideas with other developers. And once we understand the patterns, we can use solutions that people way smarter than us have already implemented. In this session, we'll take a look at several Gang of Four patterns that we regularly use without realizing it. Don't know who the Gang of Four is? Join us to find out.

You will learn:

* What design patterns are
* How you are already using design patterns (even if you don't realize it)
* How intentional use of patterns can lead to better software

**VST19 Code is for Humans**  
*Level: Introductory / Intermediate*  

The computer understands your code just fine. But what about humans? The world is constantly changing, and your applications need to change with it. Humans make those changes; sometimes it's you, sometimes it's someone else. So let's look at some practical techniques to keep code readable, such as working in small pieces, coming up with good names for methods and objects, and avoiding "clever" code. Think about the next developer who needs to change this code. Often that developer is you from six months in the future. Your future self will thank you.

You will learn:

* Focus on writing code in small chunks  
* Appropriate naming for methods, variables, objects, and properties  
* Avoiding "clever" code

**VST05 Fast Focus: Safer Code: Nullability and Null Operators in C#**  
*Level: Introductory / Intermediate*  

New projects in C# have nullable reference types enabled by default. This helps make the intent of our code more clear, and we can catch potential null references before they happen. But things can get confusing, particularly when migrating existing projects. In this session, you will learn about the safeguards that nullability provides as well as the problems you still need to watch out for yourself. In addition, you will learn the various null operators in C# (including null conditional, null coalescing, and null forgiving operators). These can make your code more expressive and safe.

You will learn:

* How compile-time warnings help you avoid null reference exceptions  
* How to use nullability to make the intent of your code clear  
* How to use the nullability operators: ?, !, ??
